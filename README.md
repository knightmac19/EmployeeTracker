# EmployeeTracker

A simple CLI application for users to navigate thru a database. 

## Description

This application allows a non-technical user to sift thru a simple database to view and amend data. The database provided in the schema.sql file is a small database of employees made up of three tables: department, employee, & role. 

Using npm mysql, a connection is made to the database (provided the user populates a SQL database using the schema.sql file). Then, with npm inquirer, the user is faced with a list of option to view or add to the database. Users can "View Departments", "Add Role", and "View Employees by Role", among other options.
